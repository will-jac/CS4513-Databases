====== Fixed-Length Records ======
Created Wednesday 02 October 2019

* Assume record size is fixed
* Each file has records of some particular type only
* Different files are used for different relations
* Then:
	* Store record **i** starting from byte **n* (i - 1)**, where **n **is the size of each record
	* Record access is simple, but records may "cross blocks"
		* Can dissallow with a modification
	* Deletion of record **i**: 
		* Move records **i + 1, ... ,  n **to **i, ..., n -1**
		* Move record **n** to **i**
		* Do not move records, but link all free records on a [[free list]]
