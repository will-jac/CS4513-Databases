====== Variable Length Records ======
Created Wednesday 02 October 2019

* Arise from:
	* Storage of multiple record types in a file
	* Record types that allow variable lengths (eg varchar)
	* Record types that allow repeating fields (eg arrays)
* Issues:
	* How to represent a single record in a way that individual attributes can be easily extracted
	* How to store variable-length records in a block such that records in a block can be easily extracted
* Variable length attributes are represented by fixed size (offset, length) with actual data stored after all fixed length attributes
* Null values are represented by a null-value bitmap
* eg:
{{.\4-var-len-rec.PNG?width=400}}

* they have a slotted page structure, eg:
{{.\4-slotted-page-structure.PNG?width=500}}
* Header contains:
	* Number of record entries
	* end of free space on the bloc
	* location and size of each record
* Records can be moved around to keep them continuous with no empty space between them
	* entry in the header must be updated
* pointers should point to the entry for the record in the header rather than directly to the record
