====== Free List ======
Created Wednesday 02 October 2019

The **free list** is a list of records that have been deleted, stored in the file itself.
Obviates the need to actually delete the data

* Store the address of the first deleted record in the file header
* Use this first record to store the address of the second deleted record, and so on
* Stored addresses ~= pointers
* Can reuse space for normal attributes of free records to store pointers
