====== Topic 4 (File Organizing, Indexing, and Hashing) ======
Created Wednesday 02 October 2019

* Database is a collection of files
* Each file is a sequence of records
* Each record is a sequence of fields
* One (simple) approach: [[Fixed Length Records]]
* Can also use (more complicated) [[Topic 4 (File Organizing, Indexing, and Hashing):Variable Length Records|Variable Length Records]]

===== Organizing Records in a File =====
Goal: effecient file organization to improve query processing

==== Heap File ====
AKA Pile File
* Records are placed in a file in the order they are inserted
* New records are inserted at the end of the file
* Effecient in insertion
* Slow in searching
* Use: Insert now, tune later

==== Sequential File ====
AKA Ordered File
* Records are placed in the file in **search-key** order
* Slow insertion
* Fast search (for the search key)
* Insertion
	* Locate the position where the record should be inserted
		* If there is free space, insert
		* If no free space, insert in an overflow block
	* Update the pointer chain
* Deletiton:
	* User pointer chains
* Need to occasionally reorganize the file to restore sequential order (from the overflow block)

=== Index-Sequential File ===
Facilitates search on search keys
Performance degrades as the file grows, both for index lookups and sequential scans through the data

* Main data file: a sequential file storing complete tuples stored on a search key
* Index: Primary index and Secondary index
	* Index files are typically much smaller than the original file
		* Primary index: index built on the search key of the main data file
		* Search key of a primary index is usually (but not necessarily) the primary key
		* Also called clustering index
	* Secondary index
		* index build on other attributes in the main data file
		* Also called non-clustering index

(generally)
* Primary index is based on primary key value
* Secondary index is based on a secondary key value (non-ordering field)
* secondary key can be a candidate (eg licence_number) or non-candidate (eg car_color) key

== Dense Index Files ==
Dense Index - index record appears for every search-key value in the file

== Sparse Index Files ==
Sparse Index - contains index records for only some search-key values
* Applicable when records are sequentially ordered on search-key
* To locate a record with search-key value K, we:
	* Find index record with the largest search-key value < k
	* Search file sequentially starting at the record to which the index record points

Compared to dense indices:
* Less space, maintenance overhead for insertions / deletions
* Generally slower on search (due to IO overhead)
* **good tradeoff**:
	* Sparse index with an index entr for every block in file, corresponding to the least search-key value in block

== Primary & Secondary Indices ==
* Offer substantial benefits when searching for records
* Updating indices imposes overhead on database modification - need to update every index when a file is changed
* Sequential scan with primary index == effecient
* Sequential scan with secondary index == expensive
	* Block fetch = milliseconds
	* index fetch = nanoseconds

**Secondary indices**
* Index record points to a bucket that contains pointers to all the actual records with that search-key value
* Secondary indices must be dense (primary indices need not be)

== Multilevel indices ==
* If a primary index does not fit in memory, access is expensive
* Solution:
	* Treat primary index kept on disk as a sequential file and construct a sparse index on it
		* outer index = sparse index of the primary index
		* inner index = primary index file
	* Can create multiple layers if even outer index is too large
	* Indices at all levels must be updated for insertion / deletion from this file


==== B Tree / B+ Tree ====
Works well despite insertions and deletions

Idea: view the array of data as a tree

B+ Tree: 
* each leaf node has a pointer to the next leaf node
* only has pointers to the main files in the leaf nodes 
	* rest of tree just points to various internal / leaf nodes

Main file: [[Topic 4 (File Organizing, Indexing, and Hashing):B-Tree|B-Tree]] , [[Topic 4 (File Organizing, Indexing, and Hashing):B+Tree|B+Tree]]
{{.\B-Tree.PNG?width=700}}

=== Comparision: ===
Typically, a B+ Tree is better

== B-Tree Advantages ==
* B-Tree may use fewer tree nodes than a corresponding B+Tree
* Sometimes possible to find the search-key value before reaching leaf nodes

== B-Tree Disadvantages: ==
* Only a small fraction of all search-key values are found early
* Non-leaf nodes are larger, so fan-out is reduced
	* B-trees typically have greater depth than B+Tree
* Insertion / Deletion are more complicated
* Implemenation is harder

=== Multi-Key Access using Indices on Single Attributes ===
* Use multiple indices for certain types of queries, eg:
select ID
from Instructor
where dept_name="finance" and salary= 8000
* strategies:
	* Use index on dept_name to find instructors with dept name Finance, test salary = 8000
	* Use index on salary to find instructors with salary 8000, test dept_name="Finance"
	* Use dept_name index to find pointers to finance, and salary index to find pointers to 8000. Take intersection of the sets of pointers.

==== Hashing ====
* Hash function h on search key k : h(k) = bucket address
* used to locate records for access, insertion, and deletion
* records with different search-key values can map to the same bucket, so much search the bucket sequentially
* Need to preallocate a ton of space (all the buckets that the hash function could possibly use)

Questions:
* Good for random or range?
	* Great for random, not good for range

=== Overflows ===
When a bucket overflows, we need to chain together additional buckets into a linked list

=== static hashing ===
* In static hashing, function //h// maps search-key values to a fixed set of //B// bucket addresses.
* Databases grow or shrink over time
	* If the initial # of buckets is too small, performance degrades due to overflows
	* If the space is correct, a significant amound of space will be waster initially
	* If db shrinks, space is again wasted
* One solution: periodically re-organize the file with a new hash function
	* expensive & disruptime
* Better: dynamically change the # of buckets

=== dynamic hashing ===
* Dynamically adjust the hash function as the DB size grows / shrinks
* number of buckes needed grows / shrinks as needed
* On deletion, combine buckets, on insert, split buckets (as needed)
	* use the right bits of the hash function to determine what to combine, eg combine 1001 and 0001
	* two buckets are buddy buckets if they:
		* have x bits in common
		* are eligible for combination (eg bucket_max_length >= bucket1_length + bucket2_length)
* Don't really understand how that works / what she was trying to show

* Advantages:
	* Don't need an overflow -> performance does not degrade as the DB grows
	* Minimal space overhead (need a directory, but it's very small)
	* No buckets need to be reserved in advanced for future growth
* Disadvantages:
	* Key lookup involves additional access to the directory
		* Needs to sit in main memory, probably

==== Ordered Indexing vs Hashing ====
* Cost of periodic re-organization
* Relative requency of insertsions and deletioins
* Desirable to optimize average access at cost of wors-case?
* Expected type of queries:
	* hashing good at specific value
	* indexes better for range

==== Multitable Clustering ====
* Used to optimize queries involving joins of two tables
* Effectively joins the tables in the cluster
* good for queries involving both department and instructor (both tables)
* bad for queries involving only depatrment (one table)
* results in variable size records
* can add pointer chains to link records of a particular relation

===== Deciding on a File Organization =====
* Type of queries
	* Random Search (Hash)
	* Range Search (Index)
	* Insertion (Heap)
	* Deletion
* Frequencies of queries
* Access time
* Insertion time
* Deletion time
* Space overhead

== Example: ==
Given the tables:
* Students(**id**, name, address)
* Courses(**courseno**, coursename, sec)
* Enroll(**id, courseno**)
* Dept(**deptname**, budget)
and queries:
1. Insert a new student and associate them with a course
	* 50/day
2. Insert a new course
	* 100/month
3. Find all students who take course no 123
	* 10/day
4. Insert department
	* 1/year
5. Find all departments whose budget is between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000
	* 6/month
